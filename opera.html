<p class="song">
(Chorus – Song)<br>
Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;<br>
Fill, O fill the pirate glass;<br>
And, to make us more than merry,<br>
Let the pirate bumper pass.
</p>

<h4 class="character">FRE</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
Stop, ladies, pray! Though I was born a pirate,<br>
And though I lived a pirate from my cradle,<br>
I renounced my wicked ways, and I repented.
</p>

<h4 class="character">RUT</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
Frederic, Frederic, let me tell you plainly,<br>
Your position is exceedingly unpleasant.
</p>

<h4 class="character">FRE</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
For today my apprenticeship expires,<br>
And I leave you, pirates all, forever.
</p>

<h4 class="character">PKG</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
Yes, Frederic, from today you are a free man.
</p>

<h4 class="character">RUT</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
Oh, do not be deceived by him, dear Frederic.
</p>

<h4 class="character">PKG</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
Here’s your indenture — you have served your time!
</p>

<h4 class="character">FIA</h4>
<p class="recitative">
(RECITATIVE)<br>
The moon is bright tonight, and the garden is silent.
</p>

<p class="song">
(SONG / ARIA)<br>
Love calls me softly through the night,<br>
Guiding my hopeful heart.
</p>
