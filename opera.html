<h2>The Pirates of Penzance</h2>

<h3>Act I – Scene: A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall</h3>

<p><strong>CHORUS OF PIRATES:</strong><br>
Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;<br>
Fill, O fill the pirate glass;<br>
And, to make us more than merry,<br>
Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>

<p><strong>FREDERIC:</strong><br>
Stop, ladies, pray! Though I was born a pirate,<br>
And though I lived a pirate from my cradle,<br>
I renounced my wicked ways, and I repented.</p>

<p><strong>RUTH:</strong><br>
Frederic, Frederic, let me tell you plainly,<br>
Your position is exceedingly unpleasant.</p>

<p><strong>FREDERIC:</strong><br>
For today my apprenticeship expires,<br>
And I leave you, pirates all, forever.</p>

<p><strong>PIRATE KING:</strong><br>
Yes, Frederic, from today you are a free man.</p>

<p><strong>RUTH:</strong><br>
Oh, do not be deceived by him, dear Frederic.</p>

<p><strong>PIRATE KING:</strong><br>
Here’s your indenture — you have served your time!</p>

The moon is bright tonight, and the garden is silent.

<p class="song fia">
(Song)  
Love calls me softly through the night,
Guiding my hopeful heart.
